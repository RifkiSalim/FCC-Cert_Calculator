# Calculator

## Overview

This calculator project is part of my entries to the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Development Libraries Certification and aims to provide a simplified approach, functionally similar to the [Javascript Calculator example](https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/).

### Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with custom classes)

### UI Style

- Glassmorphism

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers with support for negative values.

2. **Decimal Precision**: The calculator provides several decimal places of precision, ensuring accurate results, even in complex calculations.

3. **Clear and Reset**: Easily reset the calculator to its initial state by pressing the "Clear" button. This clears both input and output values, displaying 0.

4. **Consecutive Operator Handling**: If two or more operators are entered consecutively, the calculator accurately follows the order of operation precedence and performs the last operation entered.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface includes clickable elements for numbers 0-9, arithmetic operators, a decimal point, and an equal sign, making it intuitive for users to input and evaluate expressions.

## Usage

To use the Calculator:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RifkiSalim/FCC-Cert_Calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project folder.

3. Install project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and access the development server's URL (http://localhost:3000) to view and use the Drum Machine.

6. Click on the drum pads with your mouse or use the keyboard to trigger sounds.
